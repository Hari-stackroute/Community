# Organised Collections

Collections are a logical grouping of assets created by creators and are tagged with appropriate values for relevant discovery. Some relevant collections are:

\
a) Course

b) TextBook

c) PlayList

d) Episode

e) Web series

f) TV Classes



The platform further enables two types of collections to be created by users.

a) **Trackable Collection**: Any Collection can be made trackable that enables registering of the digital footprint, behaviour, and other metadata of user consumption. A Few Examples of Trackable Collections are as follows:\
&#x20;    1\) Courses\
&#x20;    2\) TV Classes / Shows\
&#x20;    3\) Training Materials\
&#x20;    4\) Collection With Assessments

b) **Non Trackable Collection**: Any Collection can be made non-trackable which can be excluded from registering user consumption data on the platform. A few Examples of Non-Trackable Collections are as follows:\
&#x20;     1\) TextBook\
&#x20;     2\) Playlist

Collections are generally grouped under metadata called "Primary Categories". This is being performed by the creator for ease of discovery and consumption for the user.&#x20;



The above capabilities of Organized collections are derived from components of Sunbird Knowlg. You can find details by clicking on the link [here](../product-and-developers-guide/organised-collections.md)&#x20;
